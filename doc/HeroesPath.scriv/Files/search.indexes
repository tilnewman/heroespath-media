            <Title>Armor Ratings</Title>
            <Text>Based on the current settings in the game data file where armor ratings for each item are stored, and the current values of material armor rating bonuses, here are some helpful general armor ratings for a creature armored with…

clothesCloth=104
clothesSoftLeather=120
clothesHardLeather=136

armoredLesserSoftLeather=233
armoredLesserSteel=532
armoredLesserDiamond=682

armoredGreaterSoftLeather=296
armoredGreaterSteel=832
armoredGreaterDiamond=1021

So a civilian in plain clothes will have about 100-150, a minimally armored creature will have about 250-500, while a well armored creature will have about 300-800.  Don’t forget that skin has a rank bonus, so that could add a max of about 50-100.  The best material for armor (highest bonus) is diamond, which adds about 200 compared to steel.

            <Text>The world of Etan suffers.

It is the year 1302 after the second moon appeared in the sky, and once again there is a change in the heavens.  The stars shine so bright that they can often be seen during the full light of day, but they bring no comfort.  Instead, their wrath screams down in meteors causing destruction and death from above.

There is trouble from below as well.  Raiders and vicious beasts, once rare, are now common in the countryside surrounding the village of Thornberry, where &lt;human/gnome&gt; call home.  Some risk the dangers outside and flee, bound for what they hope are safer lands far away.  Others, such as &lt;Pixies/beastmasters&gt;, come from their homes in the wilderness to stay within the relative safety of the city walls.

After a raiding party decimated the city guard and nearly had their way with the town, &lt;cleric/bard/knight/Sorcerer/Beastmaster/archer/human&gt; decided it was time to take action.  He/She set a bonfire and called on the willing to stand with him/her.  But only &lt;non-beast-count&gt; others arrived.  That night they took an oath before the flames to band together, to take a stand, to walk the path of heroes and fight back against the dark tide.

The town sorcerer, Rayliny Hallistar, is said to have made a discovery regarding the mysterious meteor showers.  Everyone agrees that learning from Hallistar is the best way to begin.  They take turns at watch during the night by the fire, and agree to find Hallistar at daybreak.</Text>

            <Title>Alchemy</Title>
            <Text>Alchemy
There are 32 potions and 32 herbs that can be mixed together with each other, and with special items, to create new potions, powders, and even new items.  Some highly valued items can only be acquired as the result of alchemy.  Some quests can only be completed by creating potions, powders, or items through alchemy.  Players will not be forced to engage in alchemy, but information provided during play will tempt players to attempt alchemy to acquire valuable potions, powders, and items.  Alchemy can only be attempted by players with a magic mortar and pestle.  Alchemy is more likely to be successful, the higher the player’s intelligence, and the higher the player’s % magic effect.  Whether or not the alchemy is successful, all herbs, potions, and items used in the attempt are destroyed.


Potions
Potions take the form of drinkable tonic/poison (or the non-descriptive liquor/brew/drink/infusion), or a usable rub/balm/salve/ointment/cream/mash, or acid.  Acids are both drinkable and usable, but no matter which way you choose to apply it, it’s gonna hurt…  Potions cause effects just as they are, without being the result of alchemy.

Name		Form		Permanent	Effects


Herbs
Herbs take the form of either a flower/grass/vine/stem/leaf/root/seed.  Each herb has an amount that is defined by a use count.  Herbs are all edible, and must be eaten to trigger whatever their result is, be that something beneficial or harmful.  Herbs cause effects just as they are, without being the result of alchemy.

Name 		Form		Permanent 	Effects



Form Combination Rules
Herbs mixed only with other herbs always produce a powder blend in a bag/sack/sachet/pouch.
Drinkable potions mixed with anything else always result in another drinkable potion.
A liquor mixed with anything else always results in either another liquor, drink, or brew.
Useable potions (not drinkable) mixed with others or herbs always result in another non-drinkable potion.

            <Title>Combat</Title>
            <Text>Manual:
Each creature takes a turn in the order of who has the greatest Speed attribute.

The Attack option will automatically choose a target enemy creature, usually whoever has the lowest relative health, while the Fight option allows you to specify which enemy creature to target.

To select an enemy to fight, press the ‘F’ key and then click an enemy once.  Your characters are limited to fighting enemies near you, unless they are flying.

To fly, press the ‘Y’ key, and an animation of a flapping wing will be displayed on the character who is flying.

To see a summary view with detailed information about a creature on the battlefield, click on it once.

To switch to the Inventory, press ‘I’, or double-click one of your characters.  The Inventory Screen contains all the information about your characters.

Sometimes a character will have multiple weapons to choose from.  To switch between weapons, press the ‘C’ key.

The Enter key will automatically attack, block, or skip a character’s turn, in that order, depending on which are possible.

Pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse can be used to skip past messages when you want to speed up combat.

If a character runs away or dies, it will not receive experience from the battle, even if you win the fight.

Sometimes a creature cannot move past enemies on the battlefield if there are too many blocking the way, or if some of those creatures are taking the blocking action, but flying creatures can always advance or retreat.


Hints
Whoever advances to meet an opponent is then at risk of being attacked by that opponent, so it is often wiser to wait and let your enemies advance upon you.

Tap the Enter key repeatedly to speed up combat.

If an enemy’s armor is absorbing the damage from your attacks, try tripping that enemy.

Sometimes when a creature is hit very hard he/she will become dazed, tripped, or daunted.

When a creature is healed and regains all health, it removes the Dazed, Daunted, and Panic conditions.

If a creature is hit with more than twice their maximum health, they will immediately die.

If under a natural sleep during combat, being hit will wake the creature up.

It is easier to pounce on an enemy that is Dazed, and it always works if they are Tripped, Asleep, or Unconscious.

Choose whether or not to fly carefully.  For example, if you have two dragons, flying can make them less vulnerable but it might make the remaining Beastmaster (or other character) more vulnerable.

The Lift spell removes the Tripped condition, but it will also remove the Pounced condition.

Cleric’s spell casting should be carefully considered.  On the one hand, you will want your Cleric to contribute to winning the fight, but on the other hand, you will want to save their mana for healing.

Prioritize so that you first attack the enemies that are the greatest threats.  Eliminate spellcasters, archers, and high-ranking enemies first.

If a particular enemy is curious or causing you problems, remember that you can click on it once and see a summary of its condition and equipment.</Text>

            <Title>Maps</Title>
            <Text>Use the Tiled app:  http://www.mapeditor.org/

Start a new map with these options:
	Orthogonal
	CSV
	Right Down

	Width: 40
	Height: 40
	or
	Width: 20
	Height:20

#x# of tiles is up to you depending on how big you want the map.  There is no limit.  You can change your mind later and resize the map at any time.

When saving your map, always use the .tmx file type.  This will save in XML with CSV data fields.

Use layers carefully, and save often.  Tiled will not save automatically.

Chose a name for your layers that includes the following keywords so the game engine knows what to do with them: (not case sensitive)
	ground - everything that the player is drawn on top of
	object - everything that is drawn on top of the player
	collision - contains rectangles that define where the player cannot walk
	shadow - contains only shadows cast by objects (and drawn on top of the player)

For example, a map may have the following layer names:
	ground
	ground
	ground grass
	dirt patches on ground
	ground stone path
	tree objects
	all other objects
	collisions
	shadows

NOTE:  Multiple layers with the same name works fine.

Tileset images that contain the keyword "shadow" in their name will be altered by the game engine.  They will be erased except for the shadows themselves.  So collect shadow tiles together in their own Tileset images, and use only them to place shadow tiles on the map.

The RGB color (75, 99, 127) is the default background color.  ALL Tileset images that contain that color  will have it changed to transparent by the game engine.

The layers will be drawn in order from bottom to the top as listed in the Tiled app.

The tiles will be drawn in order until the first is encountered that came from an image that contained the keyword 'object', and then the player will be drawn before that tile.

Because of this, it is wise to draw tiles on layers exclusively.  That is, give each layer a singular purpose and a fitting name with the appropriate keyword, then choose a tileset image for that layer and only place tiles from that tilset on that layer.  For example, don't place tiles from an 'objects' image on a layer named 'ground'.  In such a case, when the game engine reaches the object tile, it will start drawing all subsequent tiles on top of the player, even if they are ground tiles.  So keep layers exclusive to tile images.

            <Title>Items</Title>
            <Text>All items are made with specific materials, but some materials are more desirable than others.  Some materials carry bonuses, enchantments, a certain number of uses, or other special powers.  Here is a list of common materials, in order of rarity and power, from least to most:

Bone
Stone
Obsidian
Tin
Bronze
Iron
Steel
Jade
Amethyst
Emerald
Pearl
Ruby
Lazuli
Silver
Sapphire
Gold
Platinum
Diamond

In the inventory screen, hover the mouse over an item to reveal all the details about it, including bonuses and enchantments.

Some items belong to a Set.  All items belonging to a Set have special bonuses that are granted for each item in the Set  owned after the first.  So once you start using at least two items in a Set, the bonuses start adding up.  The more items in a Set you have, the greater the bonuses.  There is also an extra bonus for having all the items in a Set.  Items belonging to a Set can be identified by “The” in their names.  For example, Thieves have a set called “Assassin”, and the Boots belonging to that Set are named “The Assassin’s Boots”.  The Assassin’s set has seven items to collect in all: Boots, Pants, Shirt, Gloves, Cloak, Dagger, and Lock Picks.  Choose wisely between using items belonging to a Set, versus using other powerful unique items.  Sometimes using other powerful unique items collectively is better than only using a few items from a Set.  In general, once a complete Set is owned, it provides more bonuses than any collection of other powerful unique items.

Cleric’s and Sorcerer’s require a wand item to cast spells with.  When the game begins, they start out with simple wands that have the minimal required enchantment to cast spells, but there are other more powerful wand items with bonuses to mana, stats, and even to the chance that a spell is resisted.  Here are some items that enable casting spells, listed in order of rarity and desirability:  wand, shard, orb, scepter.  There are rare items that are even more powerful, some only available upon completion of quests.  The best wand items are part of a complete Set.

Bard’s require a musical instrument in order to play magical songs.  There are many different musical instruments that can be found during your adventures.  Always use the most powerful musical instrument you can.   The best musical instrument items are part of a complete Set.

            <Title>Code Problems</Title>
            <Text>“Do as I say, not as I do.”


I have fallen into the bad habit of using boost::shared_ptr for everything.
This is bad for performance because shared_ptr’s ref count increment/decrement is also atomic, which is just slowing that I don’t need.  This is also bad for clarity/debugging (and performance) because I have less control over the end-of-life of resources and they can be de-allocated at unclear or un-opportune times.  The end-of-life problem might actually be causing some of the mysterious slow passes through the engine’s primary update/draw loop.

Update:  2017-3-27
I went ahead and changed all boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr, but there are still too many in use.


All of my factories should be returning unique_ptrs, or keeping unique_ptrs and returning raw const pointers.
I’ll change my behavior now, and will look into changing some managers/factories in the wild.  I did come across one case where I couldn’t switch from shared_ptr to unique_ptr, and that was where the factory had a particular instance that was not created but shared.  In that case, you can’t have two different types of pointers for a type out in the wild, so they all were kept as shared_ptrs.

Update, 2017-5-20:
I went ahead and fixed this in all of the factory classes, which in my case are not really factories by ‘warehouses’.


I need to start using make_shared() and make_unique().
I’ll change my behavior now, but there are too many to change in the wild, and no good way to automate it.


I need to use “using” instead of “typedef”
I’ll change my behavior now, and will change existing code as I stumble upon it.  As of May 2017, I think all uses have been replaced.


I need to use auto for stack vars and non-virtual function return types.
I’ll change my behavior now, but there are too many to change in the wild, and no good way to automate it.


I have not been using brace initialization, and I should.
The benefits of curly brace initialization, or aggregate initialization, such as preventing of narrowing and illegal inits, out-way the possible problems, such as types with initializer list constructors.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have this in mind when starting to write the code.  So almost all of the code uses value initialization (parens).  I’ll change my behavior but will not go back and re-write the older code.  So expect to see a mix of initialization types.


I have places in the code where class functions return references to local members causing dangling.
These need to be changed into functions that return data via reference parameter.  I don’t know of a good way to search for this, so I’ll change them as I stumble into them in the wild.  I suppose I could write some kind of regular expression to find them…I’ll put it on my TODO list.  This isn’t such a big problem because I am pretty disciplined about my use of returned resources.  As of May 2017, all but two or three cases exist, and those cases that do still exist need to be that way.  Usage is disciplined enough to make it safe.


I used a trailing underscore to indicate a member variable instead of the prefix m_.
I had a reason for doing this, but it must have been a stupid one because…seriously, why break such a normative style.  At this point there is simply too much code in the codebase, making the change unfeasible.  I’ll just keep on as I have been to keep the style consistent.


I made function names start with a capital letter.
I had a reason for doing this, but it must have been a stupid one, again.  There is no excuse to break such a normative style.  At this point there is simply too much code in the codebase, making the change unfeasible.  I’ll just keep on as I have been to keep the style consistent.


My singletons use shared_ptr.
All my singletons use shared_ptrs for the instance pointer.  This was a (flawed) design decision made early on when I was shared_ptr happy.  I should take the time to change this.


I miss-use the singleton pattern.
I have used singletons whenever I needed a ‘manager-of-resources’ or ‘collection-of-similar-operations’ type class.  That by itself is not really a problem.  The problem is that I use these singletons as global access points which is rightly bad code smell, seeing as I should have instead been passing around pointers or references to these objects where needed.  The engine code is even conducive to passing these classes around because of how the Stage classes act as collectors/managers of resources, but I didn’t think of that soon enough.  Now there are scattered uses of singletons all over the codebase that would require too much work to change into proper passing or Acquire() Release() semantics.  So I’m not to going to bother and continue to use the singletons as I have been.  The smell isn’t that bad.


I set no limit on line lengths.
I was spoiled early in my career and never got in the habit, and I should have.  Now there is too much code to go back and change.  I’ll try and change my style from here on out to limit to 100 characters per line.


I haven’t been consisted with my usage of brackets.
I was consistently using the Allman style, then, for some stupid reason, I switched to not using brackets for single indented lines.  I have since switched back to always using brackets but there is a lot of code out there where they are missing.  Too much to go back and fix it all now.  I’ll put them back as I find them.


Use of float instead of double.
No, I didn’t do any profiling that told me floats were faster.  SFML uses floats for everything, and my use of SFML is so pervasive that I decided early on to always use float instead of double.

            <Text>When Combat is Over

When combat is over, your party will often find a stash of treasure left behind by the creatures you concurred in a chest or lockbox.  These are often locked, and if so, they often have traps waiting to spring that will harm or even kill.  You can choose which member of your party will attempt to pick the lock without setting off the trap.  You should choose whoever has the greatest luck, usually your Thief.  Your Thief should never be caught adventuring without their trusty Lock Picks.  There are many different Lock Pick items to be found in Etan, explore far and wide to find the best one you can.

            <Title>Build Times</Title>
            <Text>Notes:
All builds recorded below were run on my MacBookPro with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7, and 16 GB of 1600MHz DDR3 RAM.
In short:  LLVM= 2:34, VS17=3:26, VS17 in Parallels=4:40.
Visual Studio 17 makes a significantly smaller executable than LLVM 8.1.0, almost half the size.
Visual Studio 17 running in Parallels takes almost exactly twice as long to build as LLVM 8.1.0.
Visual Studio 17 is slowed by 1:14 or 36% when running in Parallels.
The overhaul to reduce include files shortened build times by 10-20 seconds.  (disappointing for 2-3 days of work…)



This run was the first time trial of Visual Studio NOT running in Parallels.

            <Title>Items</Title>
            <Text>Limits/Rules
Item Set cumulative bonuses apply to every item owned in the set AFTER the first.  So cumulative bonuses are granted starting with the second item equipped.

Only one Fingerclaw per hand (arm in the code) may be equipped at a time.

Only ONE may be equipped at a time:
	Whistle
	Necklace
	Beard
	Leaf
	Sheet (grouped with Covers) (Cloak/Robe/etc)
	Charm
	Brooch
	Pin
	Tuning Fork

Duplicate items do not combine bonuses.

+/- % Magic Chance is a percent adjustment to the chance that a spell/song/alchemy works or takes effect.  Note, that most sorcerer’s spells work every time, and so Magic Chance does no effect them, but most magical bard song’s effect on on creatures is not guaranteed to work every time, so Magic Chance is applied.

+/- % Magic Effect is a percent adjustment to the amount of effect that a spell/song/alchemy has if it takes effect.  Even though there is a separate trait for Bless Effect and Curse Effect, Magic Effect still applies (and is combined) to Blessing and Cursing.

***Does Bless/Curse Chance mean ‘chance to cast success’ or ‘chance effected by’?…Let’s say ‘chance to cast success’.  If you want to be less effected by Bless/Curse then -% Bless/Curse effect.  There is no Bless Resist.  If you want a trait to make Bless less likely to take effect, then you are out of luck.  The closest you can get is a negative percent adjustment to the Blessing’s effects, with -% Bless Effect.


Types
There are four item Types: Fire, Frost, Honor, and Shadow, with eight valid combinations.  Only equipment (items that can be equipped) can be typed.  If an item’s name ends in one of the eight qualifying type names: “of &lt;Fire/Frost Honor/Shadow&gt;”, and it is equipped, then it confers Type based bonuses, specified below:

If item is &lt;Material&gt;: for weapons: 10% + 5x material based +% &lt;Type&gt; damage, for armor: 4% + 1/1.5x material based +% &lt;Type&gt; resist
If item is NOT Material: for weapons +50% &lt;Type&gt; damage, for armor: +13% &lt;Type&gt; resist

            <Text>Sparks
Sprays a single enemy with a shower of molten sparks causing minimal damage.
This is the first attack spell that any magic user learns.  It only effects one enemy.  This spell is quickly replaced by learning better attack spells, but everyone has to start somewhere.


Bandage
Wraps a single character’s worst wounds in magical bandages causing a minor increase of health.
This is the first healing spell that any magic user learns.  Only effects one character.  Once a better healing spell is learned, there is little reason to ever use this spell again.


Sleep
Puts a single enemy into a natural sleep.
Creatures in a natural sleep will be woken up if hit by attacks, damaging spells, or if a beast roars.


Blanket
Puts multiple enemies into a natural sleep.
Creatures in a natural sleep will be woken up if hit by attacks, damaging spells, or if a beast roars.  Which enemies are effected is random, but the number and likelihood of success both increase with Rank, so this spell remains useful for the whole game.


Awaken
Revives a single character from unconsciousness or sleep.
Only affects one character.  This can be used to wake a character from either a natural or magical sleep.


Wake Horn
Blasts a magical 


Trip
Knocks a single enemy off of their feet and rolls them onto their back, reducing their stats and forcing them to waste a turn getting back up. 
Only affects one enemy.  Some creatures take more than one turn to get up once flipped onto their back.


Lift
Returns a single tripped character to their feet without having to waste a turn getting up.
Some creatures take more than one turn to get back on their feet, so this spell is more useful to some races than others.


Daze
Causes a single enemy to become dazed, reducing their stats, for one or more turns.
It can take multiple turns to wake from being dazed naturally without intervening.


Frighten
Scares a single enemy, reducing their stats.
It can take multiple turns to recover from being scared.


Clear Mind
Removes the Dazed and or Frightened condition from a single character.
It can take multiple turns for a creature to recover from being Dazed or Frightened without intervening.


Poison
Poisons a single enemy, causing a reduction of stats and the loss of a small amount of health each turn.
Some creatures can poison your characters just by attacking them during combat, such as poisonous snakes and Sylavin dragons.


Antidote
Cures the poisoned condition from a single character.
This spell works whether the poisoning was natural or magical.


Poison Cloud
Attempts to poison a number of enemies, reducing their stats and causing a small amount of damage each turn.  The number of creatures effected depends on the caster’s intelligence and Rank.
Some creatures breathe a poisonous cloud that can effect your characters in the same way as this spell.</Text>

            <Title>Races</Title>
            <Text>Human - Humans are a versatile race.  They are slightly stronger and more accurate with weapons, making them natural Archers, but they are a solid choice for other roles as well.  However, Humans lack the magical spark that brings luck, so they seldom make good Thieves.

Gnome - Gnomes may be short and lack strength, but they have deceptively fast hands.  They are known to be grumpy, but the touch of magic that runs through their veins makes them luckier than any other race.  You may not like them, but they make excellent Thieves, and parties without a Thief on their side will regret it.

Pixie - The Pixie is a tiny winged creature from the ancient world, but a few are still known to exist.  Their obvious lack of strength is more than made up for by their other significant advantages, including speed to keep their fragile bodies away from the melee.  They are the most intelligent race, making excellent Sorcerers and Clerics.  Pixies speak their own language, and sing so well they even make good Bards.

Wolfen - The Wolfen are relatives of Dire Wolves, but magic fuels their strength and senses.  They gain significant special abilities as they progress in rank.  They may be weak in the beginning, an difficult to raise, but for those willing to put in the required time and care they grow into fearsome allies.  As with Dragons, having a Wolfen in your party means most innkeepers will turn you away, but the advantages often out-weigh the trouble of camping outside.  In fact, having a Wolfen in your party is an excellent way to prevent being surprised by dangers in the wilderness.  One of your adventurers must be a Beastmaster to have a Wolfen in your party.

Dragon - The Dragons of Etan start out as vicious flightless lizards about half the size of a horse, but they grow into sky dwelling terrors.  As with Wolfens, having a Dragon in your party means few innkeepers will let you stay in their rooms, but the advantages often out-weigh the trouble of camping outside.  There are two types of Dragons available to join your party, Firebrand and Sylavin.  The differences between them become more apparent as they progress through the ranks, and gain special magical abilities.  One of your adventurers must be a Beastmaster to have a Dragon in your party.

Rally Drum
Attempts to embolden all party members, removing fear and doubt, and conferring the Undaunted Condition upon them.
How many party members become Undaunted depends on the Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Rousing Rhythm
Wakes party members from Natural Sleep, and removes the Dazed and Unconscious Conditions.
The chance that a Condition is removed depends on the Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Trip Beat
Confuses the feet of your enemies, causing them to fall over, bestowing the Tripped Condition.
The chance that each single enemy is Tripped depends on that creature’s Intelligence, Rank, and on the drumming Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Panic Strings
Attempts to scare all enemies, giving them the Panic Condition.
The chance that each single enemy is Panicked depends on that creature’s Intelligence, Rank, and on the drumming Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

            <Title>Image Compression</Title>
            <Text>Reducing PNG files

Most of the images were originally saved in photoshop as GIFs, but I’ve become aware that PNG was designed to be a better replacement for GIF, and is potentially more efficient.  I’ve since converted all GIFs to PNGs.  Use of tools to optimize my PNGs for file size have been successful.  Below is an analysis of the tools follow by a conclusion for how to use them.


OptiPNG
This app is good, but grayscale and palette reduction features are not fully implemented making this useless for me.


PNGReWrite
This app either adds a little to the file size compared to OptiPNG or reduces it by an order of magnitude in some rare cases.  I ran pngrewrite on the output of OptiPNG for all creature images and found so few of the files reduced that the little extra added on to the majority of files was the dominant factor, making the total size of all files larger than the results of OptiPNG.  Still, it does catch some cases where less than 256 colors are required and significantly reduce those file sizes.  There are no command line tools for pngrewrite.  The little bit added to most files makes this not an option for me.


PNGWolf
Lossless PNG file compressor that only optimizes the filters, and does not strip metadata or reduce colors, etc.  It is really intended as a ‘last step’ in the compression process to squeeze the last few bytes out.  The author only provides source, but if you google for a binary you can find one posted to a messageboard.  That Windows app was able to shave 75-750 bytes off of the results of pngrewrite, but the reduction in file size might only be the amount that pngrewrite adds on compared to OptiPNG.  Here is the windows batch file to use for pngwolf:

for %%X in (*.png) do (pngwolf.exe --max-stagnate-time=10 --7zip-mpass=15 --7zip-mmc=258 --7zip-mfb=258 --zlib-level=9 --in=%%X --out=%%X)


Photoshop
The version of Photoshop I have has the ‘Export for Web’ feature still built-in, but it is label ‘Legacy’.  Still, it works better than any other export options I could find.  Set it for PNG-8, grayscale, 16 colors, dither smooth, no metadata, and the file size is very small.  After doing this to all creature GIFs (starting at 2,911,202 bytes), the result was a total of 1,604,504 bytes.  Not bad.  About half the size.

The real question is how much more compressed this can get if the best of the above apps is applied, PNGWolf.  It looks like PNGWolf is taking off 200-500 bytes per file.  That may not be worth the trouble…


PNGQuant
This command line util can be installed with “brew install pngquant”, and it can shrink files really well.  Running PNGWolf or FileOptimizer afterwards it is a good idea, shaving approx 200-20000 more bytes depending.  Beware never to set the quality (Q) setting to less then 100 (perfect) because it has a nasty habit of dithering poorly, adding speckles in the pure white/transparent areas where there should be none.  However, you CAN use this tool as an effective first-pass compressor to reduce the color count instead of Photoshop.  Here is the command line for that:  (This will overwrite/replace files in-place, if they end up smaller.)  (Note the --strip option that will remove all metadata.)

pngquant -s 1 --skip-if-larger --strip --ext .png -f &lt;insert color count here&gt; *.png

Here is the command line for lossless compression:  (This will overwrite/replace files in-place, if they end up smaller.)  (Note the --strip option that will remove all metadata.)

pngquant -s 1 -Q 100-100 --skip-if-larger --strip --ext .png -f *.png


FileOptimizer
This is a windows only multi-format (HUGE list of supported file types) lossless compressor that uses a multi-pass approach.  For example, for PNGs, FileOptimizer employs PNGWolf, pngOut, Leanify, ECT, TruePNG, and many more.  It does the job of using all the apps I’ve described above (and many more) in the correct order, automatically.  This is a great app that does just what I need, in one step.  The only problems are (1) that it takes a LONG time on PNG files, and (2) the code is not parallelized so it doesn’t use all processors efficiently.  Still, it rocks and I’m tempted to let it run on the entire Heroes’ Path image set.  It is running away on the PC in my room on my entire photo library right now…


PNG Conclusions
Use PNGQuant for the lossy first-pass to reduce the color count to a desired value, and then FileOptimizer (which employs PNGWolf) to finish.



Reducing JPG Files

Some photo-style full-color images are just better served by the JPG format, and Photoshop’s JPG compression leaves a lot to be desired.

TinyJPG
This is a website, and it does reduce the number of colors in your original (lossy-compression) (technically), but the results look great.  It is meant for web image compression and works perfectly in that domain.  I think in most cases this is a solid choice for the ‘first step’ tool.

JPEGmini
This tool has a free version that allows 20 compressions a day.  It’s a simple straightforward drag-and-drop app that does a good job.  Good, not great.  CodeKit beats it, by far.  Skip this tool.

CodeKit
This app is really a web development tool that focuses on doing everything for you.  Shame.  If you take the time to turn off everything it tries to on the side, this can shrink JPG files remarkably.  The best part is, it’s lossless.

JPG Conclusions
If you need a lossy first-pass tool, use TinyJPG.  After, for a lossless compressor, use FileOptimizer, or if you really want to move fast, CodeKit.

            <Title>Roles</Title>
            <Text>Beastmaster -  Beastmasters allow you to include animals, such as Wolfens and Dragons, in your party.  They may be rough around the edges, but a Beastmaster’s spiritual link with animals is useful in many ways.  They can also be good fighters in the melee.  As they progress in rank, Beastmaster gain magical abilities that interact with the animals both in, and out, of your party.  This is why intelligence is the primary attribute a Beastmaster is concerned with, followed closely by strength.  Secondary attributes to consider would be accuracy and speed.

Sorcerer - The Sorcerer is a role that is completely devoted to magic.  They specialize in all the arcane arts except for healing.  They are useless with weapons, and may be weak in the beginning, but in higher ranks they are a dominating presence to be reckoned with.  A Sorcerer’s primary attribute is intelligence, but also consider speed for dodging attacks.  Luck never hurts a spell caster either...

Cleric - The Cleric is religious leader, focused on the magic of nature and all the various healing arts.  They are almost as devoted to magic as the Sorcerer, and over time will learn powerful spells of all kinds.  Most groups of adventurers find the restorative powers of the Cleric to be essential.  Having considerable charm also makes the Cleric ideal for negotiations, bartering, and diplomacy.  Primary attributes are charm and intelligence, but also consider speed for dodging attacks.  Luck never hurts a spell caster either...

Knight - Your adventures will be fraught with battle, and a Knight will serve your party well.  They may not be the brightest of companions, but they make up for it by keeping your party safe.  Knights can use the widest variety of weapons and armor.  They are the only role that gains no magical abilities as they progress in rank.  All roles have the opportunity to be granted titles that provide special bonuses and abilities, and Knights have more titles to be earned than any other role.  A Knight’s primary attributes are strength and accuracy, but consider speed as well to assist in dodging attacks.

Archer - The Archer’s best friends are his bow, and his accuracy using it.  While an Archer can swing a sword if they need to, they get special bonuses for using projectile weapons, such as slings, blowpipes, and of course, the bow and arrow.  Having an Archer is essential for the many flying enemies you will face.  The primary attributes of an Archer are accuracy and strength, but don’t discount speed and luck when using a bow...

Bard - The Bard is a jack of many trades.  They may not be the fastest, but they weave the arts of a Cleric, the spells of a Sorcerer, and sometimes even the brawn of a Knight into one role.  Most of their skill lies in magical song that aids their fellow adventurers and hampers would be dangers.  Due to their talents being spread out, Bards may not be powerful in the beginning, and inexperienced players may struggle to guide them in the early ranks.  Intelligence and Charm are most important to a Bard, but also consider strength if you want them to be warriors as well.

Thief - They are deplorable criminals, but every group of adventurers benefits from a Thief in their midst.  There will be locked doors and chests to pick open, and the need to steal back what is taken.  Some adventures are simply not available to a party without a Thief.  Luck and Speed are the Thief’s primary attributes, but also consider intelligence for the magic that will come with higher rank.

Wolfen - There is only one possible role for a Wolfen, and that is to be their loyal but vicious selves.  They grow into powerful beasts that crave the magic of moon and starlight.  Their growl will strike fear into all, and send the weaker fleeing for their lives.  But it is never wise to run from a Wolfen, because they love to chase down, trip, and devour enemies with valuables.  Consider strength and speed when crafting a Wolfen, but don’t forget intelligence for the magic that comes with higher rank.  Also consider the many advantages of having multiple Wolfens in your party.  A pack of Wolfens work together...

Firebrand - Firebrands are the classic bright red fire breathers of dragon legend.  There is magic in the fire that escapes their mouths, and it can do far more than just burn, such as destroying an enemy’s weapons and armor.  As rank increases, Firebrand dragons will also learn a few spells of their own.  Primary attributes are strength and intelligence.  While they will eventually learn to fly, consider a high speed attribute to dodge attacks.

Sylavin -  The Sylavin dragon is a more thoughtful creature than the Firebrand.  They can do more damage to a single opponent, but lack the ability to attack multiple foes at once.  They are blue-green in color, and breathe a toxic stream of freezing mist instead of fire.  They learn powerful breath attacks slower than the Firebrand, but learn to fly faster.  Sylavin dragons learn many unusual powers as rank increases, and are more versatile than the Firebrands.  Primary attributes are intelligence and strength, but as with any dragon, speed is useful for dodging attacks.

            <Title>Stats</Title>
            <Text>Strength - Simply a measure of how strong you are.  How strong an adventurer is primarily determines how much damage is dealt during combat, but strength also effects many other things.  For example, strength determines how much you can carry, what kinds of weapons you can use, and how much health you start out with.  The Strength attribute is primarily a concern for Knights and Archers, but also for Beastmasters and Bards if they are not Pixies.

Accuracy - How carefully and successfully a character aims weapons in combat.  This is not just for Archers, but for any weapon.  Archers are most concerned with Accuracy, but also any other adventurer you craft for fighting.

Luck - Luck is applied in almost every endeavor, but Thieves are primarily focused on Luck in their underhanded trade.  Spell casters also benefit from Luck.

Charm - How pleasant looking and diplomatic a character is.  Having higher Charm in a party as a whole will make beneficial, non-combat, encounters more likely.  Charm is also useful in everyday negotiations, such as buying and selling goods.  Clerics and Bards need Charm far more than any other roles.

Speed - How fast and dexterous the adventurer is.  This attribute will help with avoiding melee attacks, but is also important for a Thief’s slight of hand.

Intelligence - A measure of mental toughness and quick mindedness.  Intelligence is primarily useful to spell casters and Beastmasters, but it helps almost all roles in higher ranks with the magical abilities they will develop.  Knights are the only Role that do not develop magical abilities over time, so they have little need for Intelligence.

            <Title>Static Analysis</Title>
            <Text>Visual Studio
I added the following extra warning flags to each project in the solution:
/w14254 /w14263 /w14287 /w14296 /w14311 /w14545 /w14546 /w14547 /w14549 /w14555 /w14640 /w14826 /w14905 /w14906 /w14928 

The /analyze flag produces a lot of repeated noise, but it did find a few bugs in my codebase.



CPPCheck
This is a great tool.  Use it.  Simple, comprehensive, and it doesn’t give false positives.  Use it in MacOS natively, as easy as “brew install cppcheck”, then “cppcheck -j 7  --enable=all ../heroespath-src/src“.  Note the space between the “-j” and the “7”, unlike make.



Valgrind
The undisputed heavyweight champion of runtime analysis.  Use it.

Valgrind on MacOS (10.12 as of 2017-5-20) is a nightmare.  The brew package rejects it as incompatible, which is wise.  Building the latest Valgrind source, with a small patch found online, gets Valgrind built and installed, but then it crashes when trying to run.  I found mention of this online, and a specific svn repo revision with a patch that was supposed to get it mostly functional, but this failed to build.  I have given up on trying to make valgrind work on MacOS as of 2017-5-20, but I'll check back in every month or so for an official fix and release.

Valgrind on Linux works, but only if built from the latest source with the "./configure --enable-only64bit" option.  At the time of this writing (2017-5-20), the latest version of the Valgrind source code is 3.12.0, and it works fine in the Ubuntu VM I have running.

Heroes' Path needs to be configured/built with special compile flags for gcc that enable debugging and eliminate optimizations:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DVALGRIND_BUILD=on ../heroespath-src/src

Here is the command line for running Valgrind:
valgrind --leak-check=full --gen-suppressions=all --suppressions=../../heroespath-src/valgrind/valgrind-suppressions.txt -v ./HeroesPath

Valgrind's Memcheck tool will find a multitude of 'still reachable' blocks, but after spending an hour reviewing them they all were caused by sfml/mesa/libgl libraries so there seems to be nothing I can do about it.  I'm just going to ignore that result unless it suddenly looks higher than it usually does, and then, god help me for having to go through it all again.



PVS-Studio
I was able to use the trial and did find some bugs with it.  This is a massive pro tool with lots to offer, but the cost is ridiculous.  They do offer a way to use the tool for free if your project is open source -you have to say so in every cpp file with a special comment.  I decided that pvs-studio was worth it and have added the special comments.  The root CMakeLists.txt file now has code to copy the pvs-studio suppressions files per project to their correct locations.  This means that after every run of pvs-studio were suppressions are added, the following must occur:

~/src/heroespath-build-vs find . -name *.suppress -exec cp {} ~/src/heroespath-src/pvs-studio-suppressions/ \;
(and then check-in the newly updated suppressions files in ~/src/heroespath-src)



Flint++
Facebook’s C++ checker is simple to use, fast to run, and easy to setup.  Use it.  I like it just as much as CPPCheck and will make it a part of my regular set of static analysis tools.

            <Text>You play Heroes’ Path with a group of six adventurers called a party.  This screen is for creating characters one at a time to be in your party.  The first thing to do is decide what Roles you want a character to be.  Role is simply a character’s occupation, or type.  You should choose the combination of Roles in your party carefully, so they work well together as a team.

If you are new to the game, there are four recommended sets of Roles that are known to be effective and fun to play.  (Note that a Beastmaster is required if you want a Dragon or Wolfen in your party.)

To make a character, first select the Role and Race.  Use the text descriptions to guide you. Then hold down the space bar to summon a random set of attributes.  Drag the attributes up and down to customize them for the adventurer you are crafting.  Use the attribute description text on the right side of the screen to guide you.  If you don’t like the attribute values you have, simply hold down the space bar again to randomly summon more.  Finally, give your character a name and then click the Create button.  Once you have created all the characters you need, click the Next button.  You can always return and make more characters.
