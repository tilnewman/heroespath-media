“Do as I say, not as I do.”


I have fallen into the bad habit of using boost::shared_ptr for everything.
This is bad for performance because shared_ptr’s ref count increment/decrement is atomic, which is just slowing that I don’t need.  This is also bad for clarity/debugging because I end up with less control over the end-of-life times.  In the beginning, I had a vision for how the engine used resources that worked perfectly with shared_ptr semantics, but in the end, this well intentioned design simply turned into an excuse to use shared_ptr that was not sufficient.  The end-of-life problem might actually be causing some of the mysterious slow passes through the engine’s primary update/draw loop.

Update:  2017-3-27
I went ahead and changed all boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr, but that doesn’t address the problem of them being used in the first place.

Update: 2017-8-10
Since the last pass reading this document, I have removed almost all of the shared_ptrs.



I need to start using make_shared() and make_unique().
I’ll change my behavior now, but there are too many to change in the wild, and no good way to automate it.

Update, 2017-8-19:
Many cases have been changed, but an overhaul to search for all new’s and replace them has not yet been done.



I need to use auto for stack vars and non-virtual function return types.
I’ll change my behavior now, but there are too many to change in the wild, and no good way to automate it.



I have not been using brace initialization, and I should.
The benefits of curly brace initialization, or aggregate initialization, such as preventing of narrowing and illegal inits, out-way the possible problems, such as types with initializer list constructors.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have this in mind when starting to write the code.  So almost all of the code uses value initialization (parens).  I’ll change my behavior but will not go back and re-write the older code.  So expect to see a mix of initialization types.



I used a trailing underscore to indicate a member variable instead of the prefix m_.
I had a reason for doing this, but it must have been a stupid one because I can’t remember what it was.  There is no excuse for breaking such a universally adopted style.  At this point there is simply too much code in the codebase, and I’m fearful of such a sweeping regex replace.  I’ll probably start changing the style in new classes.  I’ll keep the style consistent within a compilation unit.


I made function names start with a capital letter.
I had a reason for doing this, but it must have been a stupid one, because, again, I can’t remember what it was.  There is no excuse to break such universal style.  At this point there is simply too much code in the codebase, making the change unfeasible.  I’ll just keep on as I have been to keep the style consistent.



I’m using singletons.
I have used singletons whenever I needed a ‘manager-of-resources’ or ‘collection-of-similar-operations’ type class.  The engine code is even conducive to passing manager references around because of how the Stage classes act as collectors of resources, but I didn’t think of that soon enough.  Now there are scattered uses of singletons all over the codebase that would require too much work to change into proper passing or Acquire() Release() semantics.  So I’m not to going to bother and continue to use the singletons as I have been.



I set no limit on line lengths.
I was spoiled early in my career and never got in the habit of limiting line length, but there is no excuse good enough.  Now there is too much code to go back and change.  I’ll change my style to limit on 100 characters per line from here on.  I should be using clang-format everywhere, but I had problems getting it to work…  I’ll fix code as I find it.



I haven’t been consistent with my usage of brackets.
I was consistently using the Allman style, then, for some stupid reason, I switched to not using brackets for single indented lines.  I have since switched back to always using Allman brackets but there is a lot of code out there where they are missing.  Too much to go back and fix it all now.  I’ll put them back as I find them.



Types in variable names.
For some reason I felt the need to put “Vec” at the end of vector names and “Enum” at the end of enum names, etc.  I think this was originally an alternative to using the postfix “List”, but it became pervasive and in the end, silly.



Lack of Unit Tests
There are reasons why a lot of the game code is not unit testable, but there is no excuse for not setting up a unit testing framework from the beginning and using it as much as possible.  I’m adding unit tests as I go, as of September 2017.



Testability
I think in an effort to give functions useful names and clear responsibilities, I fail to limit those responsibilities so the result is easily testable.  I need to get better at making smaller functions with limited parameters that are easily unit testable.



Boolean Function Parameters
I use Boolean function parameters everywhere, and I need to stop.  My modus-operandi is to add a boolean flag to functions wherever possible to make a function more versatile, but versatility does not equal simplicity or testability…



begin() and end()
I haven’t been using them and as a default I should.  I’ll change now but there are a lot of them lying around.



Override
I haven’t been using the override keyword.  I’ll start now but there is a ton of code that doesn’t use it.


Primitive Obsession and a Lack of Strong Types
I have used the “using” keyword plenty to name my own types, but not in a way that creates strong types.  For example, stats::Trait_t is used in everywhere and it smells.  Also, the use of Hungarian notation for the “_t” is a smell in itself, but I have a reason for it:  I capitalize the first letter of functions (another smell) so the “_t” is useful.  Anyway, I’ve started a process for using strong types with a type wrapper called “StrongType” and “StrongNumericType”, but I’m not sure if I will ever go back and use it in all the places I should have.  A lack of strong types is definitely a smell in this codebase.

Music and sound effects audio files are normalized to -3db in Audacity.  There is an exception for audio that is supposed to be more quiet or soft, in those cases the files are normalized to -8db.

The OGG file format is used for all audio, with the quality set to 5 of 10.  I did listening tests and found this quality setting to be the lowest where I could not hear distortion.

            <Text>
Race
Each of your characters is of a certain Race.  Race determines more than just what you look like, it also effects your starting stats.  You should choose your Race and Role to work well together.


Human
Humans are a versatile race.  They are slightly stronger and more accurate with weapons, making them natural Archers, but they are a solid choice for other roles as well.  However, Humans lack the magical spark that brings luck, so they seldom make good Thieves.


Gnome
Gnomes may be short and lack strength, but they have deceptively fast hands.  They are known to be grumpy, but the touch of magic that runs through their veins makes them luckier than any other race.  You may not like them, but they make excellent Thieves, and parties without a Thief on their side will regret it.


Pixie
The Pixie is a tiny winged creature from the ancient world, but a few are still known to exist.  Their obvious lack of strength is more than made up for by their other significant advantages, including speed to keep their fragile bodies away from the melee.  They are the most intelligent race, making excellent Sorcerers and Clerics.  Pixies speak their own language, and sing so well they even make good Bards.


Wolfen
The Wolfen are relatives of Dire Wolves, but magic fuels their strength and senses.  They gain significant special abilities as they progress in rank.  They may be weak in the beginning, an difficult to raise, but for those willing to put in the required time and care they grow into fearsome allies.  As with Dragons, having a Wolfen in your party means most innkeepers will turn you away, but the advantages often out-weigh the trouble of camping outside.  In fact, having a Wolfen in your party is an excellent way to prevent being surprised by dangers in the wilderness.  One of your adventurers must be a Beastmaster to have a Wolfen in your party.


Dragon
The Dragons of Etan start out as vicious flightless lizards about half the size of a horse, but they grow into sky dwelling terrors.  As with Wolfens, having a Dragon in your party means few innkeepers will let you stay in their rooms, but the advantages often out-weigh the trouble of camping outside.  There are two types of Dragons available to join your party, Firebrand and Sylavin.  The differences between them become more apparent as they progress through the ranks, and gain magical abilities.  One of your adventurers must be a Beastmaster to have a Dragon in your party.

            <Title>Roles</Title>
            <Text>Role
Each character in your party has a profession or specialty, designated by their Role.  There are ten Roles to choose from.


Beastmaster
Beastmasters allow you to include animals, such as Wolfens and Dragons, in your party.  They may be rough around the edges, but a Beastmaster’s spiritual link with animals is useful in many ways.  They can also be good fighters in the melee.  As they progress in rank, Beastmasters gain magical abilities that interact with the animals both in, and out, of your party.  This is why intelligence is the primary attribute a Beastmaster is concerned with, followed closely by strength.  Secondary attributes to consider would be accuracy and speed.


Sorcerer
The Sorcerer is a role that is completely devoted to magic.  They specialize in all the arcane arts except for healing.  They are useless with weapons, and may be weak in the beginning, but in higher ranks they are a dominating presence to be reckoned with.  A Sorcerer’s primary attribute is intelligence, but also consider speed for dodging attacks.  Luck never hurts a spell caster either...


Cleric
The Cleric is religious leader, focused on the magic of nature and all the various healing arts.  They are almost as devoted to magic as the Sorcerer, and over time will learn powerful spells of all kinds.  Most groups of adventurers find the restorative powers of the Cleric to be essential.  Having considerable charm also makes the Cleric ideal for negotiations, bartering, and diplomacy.  Primary attributes are charm and intelligence, but also consider speed for dodging attacks.  Luck never hurts a spell caster either...


Knight
Your adventures will be fraught with battle, and that is when a Knight will serve your party well.  They may not be the brightest of companions, but they make up for it by keeping your party safe.  Knights can use the widest variety of weapons and armor.  They are the only role that gains no magical abilities as they progress in rank.  All roles have the opportunity to be granted titles that provide special bonuses and abilities, and Knights have more titles to be earned than any other role.  A Knight’s primary attributes are strength and accuracy, but consider speed as well to assist in dodging attacks.


Archer
The Archer’s best friends are his bow, and his accuracy using it.  While an Archer can swing a sword if they need to, they get special bonuses for using projectile weapons, such as slings, blowpipes, and of course, the bow and arrow.  Having an Archer is helpful for fighting flying enemies.  The primary attributes of an Archer are accuracy and strength, but don’t discount speed and luck when using a bow...


Bard
The Bard is a jack of many trades.  They may not be the fastest, but they weave the arts of a Cleric, the spells of a Sorcerer, and sometimes even the brawn of a Knight into one role.  Most of their skill lies in magical song that aid their fellow adventurers and hamper enemies.  Due to their talents being spread out, Bards may not be powerful in the beginning, and inexperienced players may struggle to guide them in the early ranks.  Intelligence and Charm are most important to a Bard, but also consider strength if you want them to be warriors as well.


Thief
They are deplorable criminals, but every group of adventurers needs a Thief.  There will be locked doors and chests to pick open, and the need to steal back what is taken.  Some adventures are simply not available to a party without a Thief.  Luck and Speed are the Thief’s primary attributes, but also consider intelligence for the magic that will come with higher rank.


Wolfen
There is only one possible role for a Wolfen, and that is to be their loyal but vicious selves.  They grow into powerful beasts that crave the magic of moon and starlight.  Their growl will strike fear into your enemies, and send the weak fleeing for their lives.  But it is never wise to run from a Wolfen, because they love to chase down, trip, and then devour.  Consider strength and speed when crafting a Wolfen, but don’t forget intelligence for the magic that comes with higher rank.  Also consider the many advantages of having multiple Wolfens in your party.  A pack of Wolfens work together...


Firebrand
Firebrands are the classic bright red fire breathers of dragon legend.  There is magic in the fire that escapes their mouths, and it can do far more than just burn, such as destroying an enemy’s weapons and armor.  As rank increases, Firebrand dragons will also learn a few spells of their own.  Primary attributes are strength and intelligence.  While they will eventually learn to fly, consider a high speed attribute to dodge attacks.


Sylavin
The Sylavin dragon is a more thoughtful creature than the Firebrand.  They can do more damage to a single opponent, but lack the ability to attack multiple foes at once.  They are blue-green in color, and breathe a toxic stream of freezing mist instead of fire.  They learn powerful breath attacks slower than the Firebrand, but learn to fly faster.  Sylavin dragons learn many unusual powers as rank increases, and are more versatile than the Firebrands.  Primary attributes are intelligence and strength, but as with any dragon, speed is useful for dodging attacks.

For the beta, the only instrument available to Bards will be a special Lute whose back can be struck like a drum.  This allows me to have sound effects for Songs that are either short acoustic plucking guitar notes or a short bongo-like drum roll.


Rally Drum
Attempts to embolden all party members, removing fear and doubt, and conferring the Undaunted Condition upon them.
How many party members become Undaunted depends on the Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Spirit Resonance
All magical party members gain Mana through magical music.
How much Mana is gained depends on the Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Rousing Rhythm
Wakes party members from Natural Sleep, and removes the Dazed and Unconscious Conditions.
The chance that a Condition is removed depends on the Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Trip Beat
Confuses the feet of your enemies, causing them to fall over, bestowing the Tripped Condition.
The chance that each single enemy is Tripped depends on that creature’s Intelligence, Rank, and on the drumming Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Panic Strings
Attempts to scare all enemies, giving them the Panic Condition.
The chance that each single enemy is Panicked depends on that creature’s Intelligence, Rank, and on the drumming Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

Lullaby
Attempts to put all enemies into a magical sleep.
The chance that each single enemy is slept depends on that creature’s Intelligence, Rank, and on the playing Bard’s Charm, Intelligence, and Rank.

            <Title>Stats</Title>
            <Text>Stats


Strength
Simply a measure of how strong you are.  How strong an adventurer is primarily determines how much damage is dealt during combat, but strength also effects many other things.  For example, strength determines how much you can carry, what kinds of weapons you can use, and how much health you start out with.  The Strength attribute is primarily a concern for Knights and Archers, but also for Beastmasters and Bards if they are not Pixies.


Accuracy
How carefully and successfully a character aims weapons in combat.  This is not just for Archers, but for any weapon.  Archers are most concerned with Accuracy, but also any other adventurer you create for fighting.


Luck
Luck is applied in almost every endeavor, but Thieves are primarily focused on Luck in their underhanded trade.  Spell casters also benefit from Luck.


Charm
How pleasant looking and diplomatic a character is.  Having higher Charm in a party as a whole will make beneficial, non-combat, encounters more likely.  Charm is also useful in everyday negotiations, such as buying and selling goods.  Clerics and Bards need Charm far more than any other roles.


Speed
How fast and dexterous the adventurer is.  This attribute will help with avoiding melee attacks, but is also important for a Thief’s slight of hand.


Intelligence
A measure of mental toughness and quick mindedness.  Intelligence is primarily useful to spell casters and Beastmasters, but it helps almost all roles in higher ranks with the magical abilities they will develop in higher ranks.  Knights are the only Role that do not develop magical abilities over time, so they have little need for Intelligence.

            <Title>Item Materials</Title>
            <Text>Materials
There are many materials, but only 16 in the Core Set:  bone, stone, obsidian, pearl, 7 metals, and 7 gems.  Only these Core materials provide bonuses for items that vary by material.  Below is the list of Core materials in order of worth/rarity/significance/magical-effect.  Those in parens are not part of the Core Set.  Next to each Core material is the bonus assigned to it.  If, for example, an item can be used X times based on the material it is made of, then it can only be made of Core materials, and the number of uses possible is the bonus number assigned to that material.  An S in front of a material means it is part of the special set: bone, stone, obsidian, pearl.  An M in front of a material means it is a Core metal.  An G in front of a material means it is a Core gemstone.

            <Text>Spells

Sparks
Sprays a single enemy with a shower of molten sparks causing minimal damage.
This is the first attack spell that any magic user learns.  It only effects one enemy.  This spell is quickly replaced by learning better attack spells, but everyone has to start somewhere.


Bandage
Wraps a single character’s worst wounds in magical bandages causing a minor increase of health.
This is the first healing spell that any magic user learns.  Only effects one character.  Once a better healing spell is learned, there is little reason to ever use this spell again.


Sleep
Puts a single enemy into a natural sleep.
Creatures in a natural sleep will be woken up if hit by attacks, damaging spells, or if a beast roars.


Blanket
Puts multiple enemies into a natural sleep.
Creatures in a natural sleep will be woken up if hit by attacks, damaging spells, or if a beast roars.  Which enemies are effected is random, but the number and likelihood of success both increase with Rank, so this spell remains useful for the whole game.


Awaken
Revives a single character from unconsciousness or sleep.
Only affects one character.  This can be used to wake a character from either a natural or magical sleep.


Wake Horn
Blasts a magical 


Trip
Knocks a single enemy off of their feet and rolls them onto their back, reducing their stats and forcing them to waste a turn getting back up. 
Only affects one enemy.  Some creatures take more than one turn to get up once flipped onto their back.


Lift
Returns a single tripped character to their feet without having to waste a turn getting up.
Some creatures take more than one turn to get back on their feet, so this spell is more useful to some races than others.


Daze
Causes a single enemy to become dazed, reducing their stats, for one or more turns.
It can take multiple turns to wake from being dazed naturally without intervening.


Frighten
Scares a single enemy, reducing their stats.
It can take multiple turns to recover from being scared.


Clear Mind
Removes the Dazed and or Frightened condition from a single character.
It can take multiple turns for a creature to recover from being Dazed or Frightened without intervening.


Poison
Poisons a single enemy, causing a reduction of stats and the loss of a small amount of health each turn.
Some creatures can poison your characters just by attacking them during combat, such as poisonous snakes and Sylavin dragons.


Antidote
Cures the poisoned condition from a single character.
This spell works whether the poisoning was natural or magical.


Poison Cloud
Attempts to poison a number of enemies, reducing their stats and causing a small amount of damage each turn.  The number of creatures effected depends on the caster’s intelligence and Rank.
Some creatures breathe a poisonous cloud that can effect your characters in the same way as this spell.</Text>

            <Text>Image Compression

Note, all black and white PNG images have been reduced to 16 color palettes.  (so that includes all creature and items images, etc.)  


The White Border Problem
Sometimes the game engine inverts the images of creatures and items.  After inverting, there is a white outline or halo around the thing depicted.  This is a natural part of the gray smoothing pixels being turned white.  It is hardly noticeable, and so I don’t consider it a big deal.  I just live with it.  However, some images after inversion have a white border around the edges of the image, like a frame.  This is due to non-black pixels around the edges of the image.  These are so faint that I didn’t notice them when creating the images in Photoshop.  I still don’t know what I did that caused this, but there were hundreds of images with this problem so it must have been something systemic.  Anyway, re-touching each effected image manually in Photoshop would have taken too long, so I made the decision to force a pure black border around all creature and item images.  I wrote code that set the black border and reserved the images, then re-compressed them.  So all item and creature images have a single-pixel black border.

There is code in the testing stage that checks all creature and item images for the outline problem.  Run the testing stage and then grep the log for “outline”.  That will show you a log line for each creature or item image that has an off-black border that may not be visible to the naked eye.  There is also code in the testing stage that will put a black single-pixel border on all creature or item images and then re-save each one.  After this re-save, don’t forget to reduce each file’s palette down to 16 colors using PNGQuant (see below), and then re-compress the files with FileOptimizer (see below).


PNG
Most of the images were originally saved in photoshop as GIFs, but I’ve become aware that PNG was designed to be a better replacement for GIF, and is potentially more efficient.  I’ve since converted all GIFs to PNGs.  Use of tools to optimize my PNGs for file size have been very successful.  Below is an analysis of the tools followed by a conclusion for how to use them.


OptiPNG
This app is good, but grayscale and palette reduction features are not fully implemented making this useless for me.


PNGReWrite
This app either adds a little to the file size compared to OptiPNG or reduces it by an order of magnitude in some rare cases.  I ran pngrewrite on the output of OptiPNG for all creature images and found so few of the files reduced that the little extra added on to the majority of files was the dominant factor, making the total size of all files larger than the results of OptiPNG.  Still, it does catch some cases where less than 256 colors are required and significantly reduce those file sizes.  There are no command line tools for pngrewrite.  The little bit added to most files makes this not an option for me.


PNGWolf
Lossless PNG file compressor that only optimizes the filters, and does not strip metadata or reduce colors, etc.  It is really intended as a ‘last step’ in the compression process to squeeze the last few bytes out.  The author only provides source, but if you google for a binary you can find one posted to a messageboard.  That Windows app was able to shave 75-750 bytes off of the results of pngrewrite, but the reduction in file size might only be the amount that pngrewrite adds on compared to OptiPNG.  Here is the windows batch file to use for pngwolf:

for %%X in (*.png) do (pngwolf.exe --max-stagnate-time=10 --7zip-mpass=15 --7zip-mmc=258 --7zip-mfb=258 --zlib-level=9 --in=%%X --out=%%X)


Photoshop
The version of Photoshop I have has the ‘Export for Web’ feature still built-in, but it is label ‘Legacy’.  Still, it works better than any other export options I could find.  Set it for PNG-8, grayscale, 16 colors, dither smooth, no metadata, and the file size is very small.  After doing this to all creature GIFs (starting at 2,911,202 bytes), the result was a total of 1,604,504 bytes.  Not bad.  About half the size.

The real question is how much more compressed this can get if the best of the above apps is applied, PNGWolf.  It looks like PNGWolf is taking off 200-500 bytes per file.  That may not be worth the trouble…


PNGQuant
This command line util can be installed with “brew install pngquant”, and it can shrink files really well, really fast.  Running PNGWolf or FileOptimizer afterwards it is a good idea, shaving approx 200-20000 more bytes depending.  Beware never to set the quality (Q) setting to less then 100 (perfect) because it has a nasty habit of dithering poorly, adding speckles in the pure white/transparent areas where there should be none.  However, you CAN use this tool as an effective first-pass compressor to reduce the color count instead of Photoshop.  Here is the command line for that:  (This will overwrite/replace files in-place, if they end up smaller.)  (Note the --strip option that will remove all metadata.)

pngquant -s 1 --skip-if-larger --strip --ext .png -f &lt;insert color count here&gt; *.png

Here is the command line for lossless compression:  (This will overwrite/replace files in-place, if they end up smaller.)  (Note the --strip option that will remove all metadata.)

pngquant -s 1 -Q 100-100 --skip-if-larger --strip --ext .png -f *.png


FileOptimizer
This is a windows only multi-format (HUGE list of supported file types) lossless compressor that uses a multi-pass approach.  For example, for PNGs, FileOptimizer employs PNGWolf, pngOut, Leanify, ECT, TruePNG, and others.  It does the job of using all the apps I’ve described above (and many more), but the real advantage is that it performs them in the correct order.  This is a great app that does just what I need, in one step.  The only problems are (1) that it takes a LONG time on PNG files, and (2) the code is not parallelized so it doesn’t use the processor efficiently.  Still, it rocks, and I’m tempted to let it run on the entire Heroes’ Path image set.  (I eventually did using multiple windows XP VMs…)  It is running away on the PC in my room on my entire photo library right now…

Uh oh…. It seems that SFML is having a problem displaying some images compressed with FileOptimizer, the images look erratic and strange.  I re-did the compression pass on roughly 80 files that didn’t display properly, and


PNG Conclusions
Use Photoshop or PNGQuant for the lossy first-pass to reduce the color count to a desired value (usually 16, that is the color count for all item and creature images), and then use FileOptimizer (which employs PNGWolf, among many others) to finish.



JPEG
Some photo-style full-color images are just better served by the JPG format, and Photoshop’s JPG compression leaves a lot to be desired.

TinyJPG
This is a website, and it does reduce the number of colors in your original (lossy-compression) (technically), but the results look great.  It is meant for web image compression and works perfectly in that domain.  I think in most cases this is a solid choice for the ‘first step’ tool.

JPEGmini
This tool has a free version that allows 20 compressions a day.  It’s a simple straightforward drag-and-drop app that does a good job.  Good, not great.  CodeKit beats it, by far.  Skip this tool.

CodeKit
This app is really a web development tool that focuses on doing everything for you.  Shame.  If you take the time to turn off everything it tries to on the side, this can shrink JPG files remarkably.  The best part is, it’s lossless.

JPEG Conclusions
If you need a lossy first-pass tool, use TinyJPG.  After, for a lossless compressor, use FileOptimizer.

            <Title>Armor Ratings</Title>
            <Text>Armor Ratings

Based on the current settings in the game data file where armor ratings for each item are stored, and the current values of material armor rating bonuses, here are some helpful general armor ratings for a creature armored with, as of 2017-6-20:

clothesCloth=104
clothesSoftLeather=120
clothesHardLeather=136

armoredLesserSoftLeather=233
armoredLesserSteel=532
armoredLesserDiamond=682

armoredGreaterSoftLeather=296
armoredGreaterSteel=832
armoredGreaterDiamond=1021

So a civilian in plain clothes will have an armor rating of about 100-150, a minimally armored creature will have about 250-500, while a well armored creature will have about 300-800.  Don’t forget that skin has a rank bonus, so that could add a max of about 50-100.  The best material for armor (highest bonus) is diamond, which adds about 200 compared to steel.

            <Title>Alchemy</Title>
            <Text>Alchemy
There are 32 potions and 32 herbs that can be mixed together with each other to create new concoctions.  This process of mixing potions and herbs is called Alchemy.  The results from Alchemy can be applied to items to enchant them, but this is not considered Alchemy.  Some highly valued items can only be created this way.  Some quests can only be completed through Alchemy or item enchantment.  Players will not be forced to engage in Alchemy to win the game, but it is a way to gain advantage, so information provided during play will remind and tempt.  Alchemy can only be performed by players with a magic mortar and pestle item.  Alchemy never fails.  It always results in a new concoction with properties based on the ingredients.  Some combinations result in a special, named, concoction that is more than the sum of its parts.  These combinations are called recipes.  Some recipes will be given to the player in the manual, and some are only revealed while adventuring.

Potions
Potions take the form of a drinkable tonic, poison, liquor, brew, drink, or infusion, or a usable rub, balm, salve, ointment, cream, mash.  There are also potions that are acids.  Acids are both drinkable and usable, but no matter which way you choose to apply it, it’s gonna hurt…  Each Potion has effects that can be applied even before they are mixed in Alchemy.

Herbs
Herbs take the form of either a flower, grass, vine, stem, leaf, root, or seed.  Each herb has an amount that is defined by a use count.  Herbs are all edible and must be eaten to trigger whatever their effect is, whether beneficial or harmful.  Each Herb has effects that can be applied by eating them even before they are mixed in Alchemy.

Form Combination Rules
Herbs mixed only with other herbs always produce a powder blend in a bag/sack/sachet/pouch.
Drinkable potions mixed with anything else always result in another drinkable potion.
A liquor mixed with anything else always results in either another liquor, drink, or brew.
Potions that are not drinkable, when mixed with other potions or herbs always result in another non-drinkable form.

            <Title>Static Analysis</Title>
            <Text>Static Analysis


Visual Studio
I added the following extra warning flags to each project in the solution:
/w14254 /w14263 /w14287 /w14296 /w14311 /w14545 /w14546 /w14547 /w14549 /w14555 /w14640 /w14826 /w14905 /w14906 /w14928 

The /analyze flag produces a lot of repeated noise, but it did find a few bugs in my codebase.



CPPCheck
This is a great tool.  Use it.  Simple, comprehensive, and it doesn’t give false positives.  Use it in MacOS natively, as easy as “brew install cppcheck”, then “cppcheck -j 7  --enable=all ../heroespath-src/src“.  Note the space between the “-j” and the “7”, unlike make.



Valgrind
The undisputed heavyweight champion of runtime analysis.  Use it.

Valgrind on MacOS (10.12 as of 2017-5-20) is a nightmare.  The brew package rejects it as incompatible, which is wise.  Building the latest Valgrind source, with a small patch found online, gets Valgrind built and installed, but then it crashes when trying to run.  I found mention of this online, and a specific svn repo revision with a patch that was supposed to get it mostly functional, but this failed to build.  I have given up on trying to make valgrind work on MacOS as of 2017-5-20, but I'll check back in every month or so for an official fix and release.

Valgrind on Linux works, but only if built from the latest source with the "./configure --enable-only64bit" option.  At the time of this writing (2017-5-20), the latest version of the Valgrind source code is 3.12.0, and it works fine in the Ubuntu VM I have running.

Heroes' Path needs to be configured/built with special compile flags for gcc that enable debugging and eliminate optimizations:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DVALGRIND_BUILD=on ../heroespath-src/src

Here is the command line for running Valgrind:
valgrind --leak-check=full --gen-suppressions=all --suppressions=../../heroespath-src/valgrind/valgrind-suppressions.txt -v ./HeroesPath &lt;stage&gt;

Valgrind's Memcheck tool will find a multitude of 'still reachable' blocks, but after spending an hour reviewing them they all were caused by sfml/mesa/libgl libraries so there seems to be nothing I can do about it.  I'm just going to ignore that result unless it suddenly looks higher than it usually does, and then, god help me for having to go through it all again.



PVS-Studio
I was able to use the trial and did find some bugs with it.  This is a massive pro tool with lots to offer, but the cost is ridiculous.  They do offer a way to use the tool for free if your project is open source -you have to say so in every cpp file with a special comment.  I decided that pvs-studio was worth it and have added the special comments.  The root CMakeLists.txt file now has code to copy the pvs-studio suppressions files per project to their correct locations.  This means that after every run of pvs-studio were suppressions are added, the following must occur:

~/src/heroespath-build-vs find . -name *.suppress -exec cp {} ~/src/heroespath-src/pvs-studio-suppressions/ \;
(and then check-in the newly updated suppressions files in ~/src/heroespath-src)



Flint++
Facebook’s C++ checker is simple to use, fast to run, and easy to setup.  Use it.  I like it just as much as CPPCheck and will make it a part of my regular set of static analysis tools.

            <Text>Character Creation

You play Heroes’ Path with a group of six adventurers called a party.  This screen is for creating characters one at a time to be in your party.  The first thing to do is decide what Roles you want a character to be.  Role is simply a character’s occupation, or type.  You should choose the combination of Roles in your party carefully, so they work well together as a team.

If you are new to the game, there are four recommended combinations of Roles that are known to be effective.  (Note that a Beastmaster is required if you want a Dragon or Wolfen in your party.)

Classic
Knight
Archer
Bard
Thief
Cleric
Sorcerer



Pet
Knight
Beastmaster
Dragon or Wolfen
Bard
Thief
Cleric



Wing
Beastmaster
Firebrand Dragon
Sylavin Dragon
Sorcerer or Bard
Thief
Cleric



Howler
Beastmaster
Wolfen
Wolfen
Wolfen
Thief
Cleric


To make a character, first select the Race and Role.  Use the text descriptions to guide you. Then hold down the space bar to summon a random set of attributes.  Drag the attributes up and down to customize them for the adventurer you are creating.  Use the attribute description text on the right side of the screen to guide you.  If you don’t like the attribute values you have, simply hold down the space bar again to randomly summon more.  Finally, give your character a name and then click the Create button.  Once you have created all the characters you need, click the Next button.  You can always return to this screen and make more characters later.

            <Text>Items


Materials
All items are made with specific materials, but some materials are more desirable than others.  Some materials carry bonuses, enchantments, a certain number of uses, or other special powers.  Here is a list of common materials, in order of rarity and power, from least to most:

Bone
Stone
Obsidian
Tin
Bronze
Iron
Steel
Jade
Amethyst
Emerald
Pearl
Ruby
Lazuli
Silver
Sapphire
Gold
Platinum
Diamond

There are many more ways that an item can vary apart from the material it is made of.  Most significantly, an item an be magical, that is, enchanted to give the creature holding or equipping it percent bonuses to various Traits.  Read more about Traits in the paragraph below.  For example, an item might be enchanted to increase your armor rating Trait by a certain percentage.  There are also items that will provide bonuses or perform amazing effects when used.  For example, one of the items you can find in your adventures are Spider Eggs, that when used, will summon Giant Spider creatures to fight for your party during combat.  Magical or enchanted items have a star ‘*’ at the end of their names.  In the inventory screen, hover the mouse over an item to reveal all the details about it, including all of its enchantments.


Enchanted Items
Each of your characters has forty-four Traits that can be effected by enchanted items.  All Traits are percentage bonuses.  For example, if your character normally has 20 Strength, but also has an enchanted item that provides a 5% Strength Trait Bonus, then your character will have 21 Strength total.  In the Inventory screen, press the ‘A’ key to see all of a character’s Traits, including all the bonuses to those Traits gained from the sum of all enchantments.  See Traits.

With so many Traits, the choice of which item is best for a character can get confusing.  To make the decision simple and clear, there is a comparison feature in the Inventory Screen.  Select an item from both the equipped and unequipped list boxes, and then press the ‘X’ Key.  Two Trait lists will appear side-by-side for easy comparison.  The first list on the left will show the character’s traits as they are, and the second list on the right will show what that character’s Traits would be if the items were reversed, that is, if the unequipped item was equipped in the other’s place.


Item Sets
Some items belong to a Set.  All items belonging to a Set are magical, enchanted to have special bonuses that you get from equipping one item, and then even bigger bonuses you get after equipping all of the items in the Set.  Items belonging to a Set can be identified by ‘The’ in their names.  For example, Thieves have a set called ‘The Assassin’s’, and the Boots belonging to that Set are named ‘The Assassin’s Boots’.  The Assassin’s Set has seven items to collect in all: Boots, Pants, Shirt, Gloves, Cloak, Dagger, and Lock Picks.  The special bonus for the complete Set will not take effect until all items in the Set are equipped.  It is perfectly fine to wear items belonging to non-matching Sets.  The individual bonuses for those items will still take effect even though they are non-matching.


Wands
Cleric’s and Sorcerer’s require an enchanted item to cast spells with, typically a wand.  When the game begins, they start out with simple wooden wands that have the minimal required enchantment to cast spells with.  Keep an eye out for other more powerful items with bonuses to mana, stats, and even to the chance that a spell is cast or resisted.  Here are some items that enable casting spells, listed in order of rarity and desirability:  wand, shard, staff, orb, scepter.  There are rare items that are even more powerful, some only available upon completion of quests.


Musical Instruments
Bard’s require a musical instrument in order to play magical songs.  There are many different musical instruments that can be found during your adventures.


Elemental Types
There are four elemental powers in Etan: Fire, Frost, Honor, and Shadow.  Every weapon and attack spell has the ability to cause extra elemental damage, and every piece of armor (and some other enchanted items) can help you characters resist elemental damage.  Look for items whose named end with ‘of Fire’, ‘of Frost’, ‘of Honor’, and ‘of Shadow’, or a combination such as ‘of Shadow and Fire’, etc.  These magic items carry elemental damage and resistance bonuses.


Named Items
Some magical items are named, and they have enchantments with bonuses that are common to those names.  For example, the name ‘Winter’ may be seen in front of a weapon’s name, meaning it has the ‘Winter’ enchantment, which is a +33% to the Trait ‘Frost Damage’.



With all the various Materials, Enchantments, Names, and Elemental types, there are roughly a half-million different items in the game!

            <Title>Combat</Title>
            <Text>Combat

Each creature takes a turn in the order of who has the greatest Speed stat.

The Attack option will automatically choose a target enemy creature, usually whoever has the lowest relative health.  The Fight option allows you to specify which enemy creature to target.  When you want to pick which enemy to fight yourself, press the ‘F’ key and then click an enemy once.  Your characters are limited to fighting enemies near you, unless they are flying.

To fly, press the ‘Y’ key.  An animated flapping wing will be displayed on any creature who is flying.

To see a summary view with detailed information about a creature on the battlefield, click on it once.

To switch to the Inventory, press ‘I’, or double-click one of your characters.  The Inventory Screen contains all the information about your characters.

Sometimes a character will have multiple weapons to choose from.  To switch between weapons, press the ‘X’ key.

The Enter key will automatically attack, block, or skip a character’s turn, in that order, depending on which are possible.  If you want to speed up combat and use all default actions, keep pressing the Enter key.  Pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse can be used to skip past messages when you want to speed up combat.

If a character runs away or dies, it will not receive experience from the battle, even if you win the fight.

Sometimes a creature cannot move past enemies on the battlefield if there are too many in the way, or if some of those creatures are Blocking, but flying creatures can always advance or retreat.


Hints
Whoever advances to meet an opponent is then at risk of being attacked by that opponent, so it is often wiser to wait and let your enemies come to you.

If an enemy’s armor is absorbing the damage from your attacks, try tripping that enemy before attacking.

Sometimes when a creature is hit very hard he/she will become dazed, tripped, or daunted.

When a creature is healed and regains all health, it removes the Dazed, Daunted, and Panic conditions.

If a creature is hit with more than twice their maximum health, they will die.

If under a natural sleep during combat, being hit will wake the creature up.

It is easier to pounce on an enemy that is Dazed, and it always works if they are Tripped, Asleep, or Unconscious.

Choose whether or not to fly carefully.  For example, if you have two dragons, flying can make them less vulnerable but it might make the remaining Beastmaster (or other characters) more vulnerable.

The Lift spell removes the Tripped condition, but it will also remove the Pounced condition.

Cleric’s spell casting should be carefully considered.  On the one hand, you will want your Cleric to contribute to winning the fight, but on the other hand, you will want to save their mana for healing.

Prioritize so that you first attack the enemies that are the greatest threats.  Eliminate spellcasters, archers, and high-ranking enemies first.

If a particular enemy is curious or causing you problems, remember that you can click on it once and see a summary of its condition and equipment.

            <Text>When Combat is Over

When combat is over, your party may find a items left behind that your concurred enemies wore or that they had stashed in a locked chest.  These are often boobytrapped to deter thieves.  Upon finding a chest, you can either leave it alone or attempt to pick the lock without springing the trap.  Choose wisely, because traps are dangerous and can kill entire parties.  You will have the option of choosing who in your party will attempt to pick the lock.  You should choose whoever has the greatest Luck stat, typically your Thief.  Your Thief should never be caught adventuring without their trusty Lock Picks.  There are many different Lock Pick items to be found in Etan, explore far and wide to find the best one you can.

            <Title>Maps</Title>
            <Text>Maps

Use the Tiled app:  http://www.mapeditor.org/

Start a new map with these options:
	Orthogonal
	CSV
	Right Down

	Width: 40
	Height: 40
	or
	Width: 20
	Height:20

#x# of tiles is up to you depending on how big you want the map.  There is no limit.  You can change your mind later and resize the map at any time.

When saving your map, always use the .tmx file type.  This will save in XML with CSV data fields.

Use layers carefully, and save often.  Tiled will not save automatically.

Chose a name for your layers that includes the following keywords so the game engine knows what to do with them: (not case sensitive)
	ground - everything that the player is drawn on top of
	object - everything that is drawn on top of the player
	collision - contains rectangles that define where the player cannot walk
	shadow - contains only shadows cast by objects (and drawn on top of the player)

For example, a map may have the following layer names:
	ground
	ground
	ground grass
	dirt patches on ground
	ground stone path
	tree objects
	all other objects
	collisions
	shadows

NOTE:  Multiple layers with the same name works fine.

Tileset images that contain the keyword "shadow" in their name will be altered by the game engine.  They will be erased except for the shadows themselves.  So collect shadow tiles together in their own Tileset images, and use only them to place shadow tiles on the map.

The RGB color (75, 99, 127) is the default background color.  ALL Tileset images that contain that color  will have it changed to transparent by the game engine.

The layers will be drawn in order from bottom to the top as listed in the Tiled app.

The tiles will be drawn in order until the first is encountered that came from an image that contained the keyword 'object', and then the player will be drawn before that tile.

Because of this, it is wise to draw tiles on layers exclusively.  That is, give each layer a singular purpose and a fitting name with the appropriate keyword, then choose a tileset image for that layer and only place tiles from that tilset on that layer.  For example, don't place tiles from an 'objects' image on a layer named 'ground'.  In such a case, when the game engine reaches the object tile, it will start drawing all subsequent tiles on top of the player, even if they are ground tiles.  So keep layers exclusive to tile images.

            <Text>Rank Class
As your characters advance into higher ranks, they also advance through general levels of skill called Rank Classes.  As you can see in the lists below, Wolfens reach Elder status sooner than Dragons, but in the end, dragons are more powerful.  As your beasts progress in Rank Class, you will notice their roars becoming stronger and louder.  Advances in Rank Class also brings bonuses to stats and the acquisition of new abilities.

            <Title>Items</Title>
            <Text>Items
There are approximately half a million different items in the game.  There are 40 different types of weapons (swords/bows/etc.), 38 different pieces of armor (shields/helms/etc.), 16 different materials they can be made of or jeweled/adorned with, 60 different named enchantments (Dancing/Noble/Soldier’s/etc.), and 4 basic elemental types (Fire/Frost/Honor/Shadow).  

Limits/Rules
Item Set cumulative bonuses apply to every item owned in the set AFTER the first.  So cumulative bonuses are granted starting with the second item equipped.

Only one Fingerclaw per hand (arm in the code) may be equipped at a time.

Only ONE of the following item types may be equipped at a time:
	Whistle
	Necklace
	Beard
	Leaf
	Sheet (grouped with Covers) (Cloak/Robe/etc)
	Charm
	Brooch
	Pin
	Tuning Fork

Duplicate items do not combine bonuses.

Magic/Bless/Curse Cast changes the chance that a cast spell/song/alchemy is successful.  Cast means: “from the perspective of the attempting caster/sender”.  Note, that most sorcerer’s spells work every time, and so Magic Cast does nothing in almost all of those cases, but most magical bard songs do not always work, so Magic Cast is applied in almost all of those cases.

Magic/Bless/Curse Effect changes the magnitude of effect created by the spell that is successfully cast.  Effect means:  “from the perspective of the creator/maker of the effect”.

Magic/Bless/Curse Resist charges the magnitude of effect absorbed by the target of a spell that is successful.  Resist means: “from the perspective of the target/receiver” of the spell.  Magic Resist will not alter helpful magic.  So players will want their Magic/Bless/Curse Resist to be high so that enemy spells cast on them have less of an effect, but it will not impede the effect of helpful spells, such as another player character Cleric’s healing spell.


Elemental Types
There are four item Elemental Types: Fire, Frost, Honor, and Shadow, with eight valid combinations.  Only equipment (items that can be equipped) can be typed.  If an item’s name ends in one of the eight qualifying type names: “of &lt;Fire/Frost Honor/Shadow&gt;”, and it is equipped, then it confers Type based bonuses, specified below:

If item is &lt;Material&gt;: for weapons: 10% + 5x material based +% &lt;Type&gt; damage, for armor: 4% + 1/1.5x material based +% &lt;Type&gt; resist
If item is NOT Material: for weapons 50% &lt;Type&gt; damage, for armor: 13% &lt;Type&gt; resist

            <Text>Introduction

The world of Etan suffers.

It is the year 1302 after the second moon appeared in the sky, and once again there is a change in the heavens.  The stars shine so bright that they can often be seen during the full light of day, but they bring no comfort.  Instead, their wrath screams down in meteors causing destruction and death from above.

There is trouble from below as well.  Raiders and vicious beasts, once rare, are now common in the countryside surrounding the village of Thornberry, where &lt;human/gnome&gt; call home.  Some risk the dangers outside and flee, bound for what they hope are safer lands far away.  Others, such as &lt;Pixies/beastmasters&gt;, come from their homes in the wilderness to stay within the relative safety of Thornberry’s city walls.

After a raiding party decimated the city guard, and nearly had their way with the town, &lt;cleric/bard/knight/Sorcerer/Beastmaster/archer/human&gt; decided it was time to take action.  He/She set a bonfire and called on the willing to stand with him/her.  But only &lt;non-beast-count&gt; others arrived.  That night they took an oath before the flames to band together, to take a stand, to fight back against the dark tide, to walk the path of heroes.

The town sorcerer, Torren Hallistar, is said to have made a discovery regarding the mysterious meteor showers.  Everyone agrees that learning from Hallistar is the best way to begin.  They agree to find Hallistar at daybreak, and take turns keeping watch by the light of the fire.  They had no idea that evil eyes were already watching.</Text>
