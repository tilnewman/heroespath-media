You play Heroes’ Path with a group of six adventurers called a party.  This screen is for creating characters one at a time to be in your party.  The first thing to do is decide what Roles you want a character to be.  Role is simply a character’s occupation, or type.  You should choose the combination of Roles in your party carefully, so they work well together as a team.<br/>

If you are new to the game, there are four recommended combinations of Roles that are known to be effect...</p>

Sometimes the game engine inverts the images of creatures and items.  After inverting, there is a white outline or halo around the thing depicted.
