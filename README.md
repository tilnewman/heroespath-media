# The Heroes’ Path Resource Repository README
This collection of files contains the images, sounds, music, fonts, documents, and all other resources required to run the Heroes’ Path game.

## About the Game
Heroes' Path is an open-source, free (non-commercial), simple, 2D game in the classic RPG turn-based style.  It was created more as a learning exercise than as an attempt to finish a full game.  I intend to implement a few hours worth of playtime, and then leave it as a fully-playable, all be it short, running game.  Given the permissive license the software and resource files are released under, it is possible for others to finish the game or to make their own ‘spin-off’ versions.
